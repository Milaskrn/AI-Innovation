Bing Chat also integrates with Microsoft Edge, Cortana, and Bing app, and can generate images, graphs, tables, and lists. However, Bing Chat could improve its ability to handle complex and open-ended questions, generate more natural and human-like responses, and add more localized features for Indonesian users.

For users who want to have fluid and creative conversations with references from various sources, Bard AI may be a better choice, as it uses LaMDA technology to provide diverse and creative answers. Bard AI also can reference texts from other languages, including Indonesian, and can generate poems, stories, jokes, and songs. However, Bard AI could improve its accuracy and relevance of its answers, support multiple languages, and add more localized features for Indonesian users.

For users who want to explore the possibilities and limitations of language models, ChatGPT may be a better choice, as it uses a large-scale language model to generate imaginative and engaging content. ChatGPT also can generate texts in other languages, including Indonesian, and can generate code, essays, lyrics, and celebrity parodies.
