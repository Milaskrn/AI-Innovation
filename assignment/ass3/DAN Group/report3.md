# WHAT is "Inciteful" ?
Inciteful is an AI-powered tool designed to assist researchers in the process of literature review and discovery of academic papers. It uses machine learning and natural language processing to analyze the content of numerous papers related to a specific research question or topic input by the user[1][4].

Inciteful has two main features:

1. **Paper Discovery**: This feature allows researchers to find new papers relevant to a specific paper they're interested in. It builds a network of papers from citations and uses network analysis algorithms to analyze the network[1][3][4].

2. **Connection Analysis**: This feature allows researchers to see how two papers are connected with each other[3].

The tool leverages citation networks to create a robust web of interconnected papers, providing valuable insights into similar works, important contributions, and prolific authors and institutions[4]. It also uses continuous learning algorithms to refine its recommendations based on user feedback, thereby improving the relevance and accuracy of its literature reviews over time[1][4].

Inciteful is accessible to researchers worldwide and is available free of charge, making it a valuable resource for the academic community[4]. It is designed to streamline the literature review process, save valuable time and effort, and provide deeper insights into the research domain[4][7].

# An Example of using "Inciteful" for a regional Innovation literature review
## Step 1
Access www.inciteful.xyz

## Step 2
We already have a paper reference regarding the use of scientific data for regional innovation. So we copied the DOI from the paper, then pasted it into inciteful. The DOI is 10.1051/e3sconf/202021402054. Or we can use the title of the paper, "Big Data Industrial Agglomeration Promoting Regional Innovation: Comparison between Guangzhou and Zhaoqing in China".

## Step 3
Analyze the Results. These are a list of related papers :

## Step 4
Add Relevant Papers.

## Step 5
Visualize Connections.

## Step 6
Download Findings. We can save our findings into BibTex, RIS, Mendeley or Zotero format. In this case we use RIS format.
<img width="996" alt="image" src="https://github.com/drshahizan/AI-Innovation/assets/150221185/6a347d4d-8d10-4dcb-b2bd-4cf1aa046d7f">

<img width="826" alt="image" src="https://github.com/drshahizan/AI-Innovation/assets/150221185/b45a38a4-984a-42b8-856a-6f27e55ca223">

## Step 7
Continuous Learning. Then, we can import the references' RIS into citation management such as BibTex, RIS, Mendeley or Zotero and continue reading our papers.
