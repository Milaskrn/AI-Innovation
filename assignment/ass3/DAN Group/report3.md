# WHAT is "Inciteful" ?
Inciteful is an AI-powered tool designed to assist researchers in the process of literature review and discovery of academic papers. It uses machine learning and natural language processing to analyze the content of numerous papers related to a specific research question or topic input by the user[1][4].

Inciteful has two main features:

1. **Paper Discovery**: This feature allows researchers to find new papers relevant to a specific paper they're interested in. It builds a network of papers from citations and uses network analysis algorithms to analyze the network[1][3][4].

2. **Connection Analysis**: This feature allows researchers to see how two papers are connected with each other[3].

The tool leverages citation networks to create a robust web of interconnected papers, providing valuable insights into similar works, important contributions, and prolific authors and institutions[4]. It also uses continuous learning algorithms to refine its recommendations based on user feedback, thereby improving the relevance and accuracy of its literature reviews over time[1][4].

Inciteful is accessible to researchers worldwide and is available free of charge, making it a valuable resource for the academic community[4]. It is designed to streamline the literature review process, save valuable time and effort, and provide deeper insights into the research domain[4][7].
