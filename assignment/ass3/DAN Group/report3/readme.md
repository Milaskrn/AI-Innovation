# How Does INCITEFUL Use Machine Learning To Analyze Literature
Inciteful, an AI-powered tool, uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze literature for academic research. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLP is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It's concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. In essence, it allows machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable and meaningful way[3][9][12][15].

2. **Machine Learning**: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data[4][10].

3. **Application in Inciteful**: When a user inputs a specific research question or topic into Inciteful, the tool uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the content of numerous papers related to the input. This analysis is not just a simple keyword search; it involves understanding the context, semantics, and relevance of the content in relation to the input, which is made possible by NLP[1][5].

4. **Continuous Learning**: Inciteful uses continuous learning algorithms, a type of machine learning where the model continually updates and refines its knowledge as new data comes in. In this case, the new data would be user feedback. This allows the tool to improve its recommendations over time, making them more accurate and relevant to the user's research question or topic[1][5].

5. **Outcome**: The result is an automated literature review that's tailored to the user's specific research needs. This not only saves time but also ensures a comprehensive and relevant review of the literature[1][5].

In summary, Inciteful uses a combination of NLP and machine learning to understand, analyze, and generate literature reviews based on user input and feedback. This allows it to provide highly relevant and accurate literature reviews, thereby streamlining the literature review process for academic research[1][5].
