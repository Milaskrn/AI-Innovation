# Assignment 3: Comparative Analysis of Literature Search Tools


## Objective:
Compare and evaluate the efficiency of different literature search tools in retrieving relevant information in the field of computer science.

## Instructions:

1. **Select a Specific Research Topic:**
   - Choose a focused and specific research topic within the field of computer science that interests you. Ensure that the topic is broad enough to yield results from various literature search tools.

2. **Choose Four Literature Search Tools:**
   - Select four literature search tools for comparison. Examples include Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar. Ensure a mix of both general and specialized tools.

3. **Conduct Literature Searches:**
   - Use each selected tool to conduct a literature search on your chosen topic. Make sure to use similar search queries for consistency.

4. **Document and Compare Results:**
   - Record and document the results from each literature search. Consider the following parameters for comparison:
     - Relevance: Evaluate the relevance of the retrieved articles to your research topic.
     - Coverage: Assess the comprehensiveness of the database in capturing relevant publications.
     - User-Friendliness: Consider the ease of use, interface, and accessibility of each tool.

5. **Write a Comprehensive Report:**
   - Structure your report with the following sections:
     - **Introduction:**
       - Briefly introduce the importance of literature search tools in research.
       - State your chosen research topic.

     - **Literature Search Methodology:**
       - Provide details on the search queries used for each tool.
       - Mention any filters or limitations applied during the searches.

     - **Results and Comparison:**
       - Present the results of each literature search.
       - Compare the relevance, coverage, and user-friendliness of each tool.

     - **Strengths and Weaknesses:**
       - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each literature search tool based on your findings.
       - Consider aspects such as precision, recall, and the types of sources included.

     - **Conclusion:**
       - Summarize the key findings.
       - Provide recommendations on which tool(s) are most suitable for different research needs within computer science.

6. **Conclude with Recommendations:**
   - Based on your analysis, conclude the report with recommendations on the most suitable literature search tool(s) for different types of research needs in computer science.
