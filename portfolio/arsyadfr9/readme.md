Hello, I'm Arsyad, a Water Distribution Manager at Perumda Tirtawening. I graduated from the Environmental Engineering Bachelor program at Universitas Indonesia in 2020. My academic journey included research on the temporal analysis of radiocesium concentration in sewage sludge after the Fukushima Daichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, which was published in a conference. You can find the paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343266716_Temporal_Analysis_of_Radiocesium_Concentration_in_Sewage_Sludge_after_Fukushima_Daichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant_Accident).

In addition to my academic achievements, I bring hands-on experience from working in environmental laboratories. I've also contributed to freelance projects, collaborating with the Ministry of Education and Culture to monitor grant projects for schools in Kalimantan, Sumatera, and Sumba.

Currently, I'm pursuing further studies at Universitas Padjadjaran, majoring in Data Science and Business Analytics. While I'm relatively new to GitHub and Python, I've been actively learning and exploring various aspects of data analytics and AI. Here's a snapshot of my current skills and interests:

## Learning Journey

- 👩‍💻 **Python:** I've covered the basics of Python programming.
- 📊 **Data Analytics:** Explored basic statistics and data analysis using tools like Pandas.
- 📝 **NLP:** Acquired foundational knowledge in Natural Language Processing.
- 🖼️ **Image Analytics:** Delved into basic image analytics concepts and techniques.
- 🍊 **Orange:** Familiar with basic usage of Orange for data visualization and analysis.

## What I'm really pursuing during my study
